        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am from Miami, Florida. I am currently studying
            nursing at FIU for my undergrad, I recently finished
            playing collegiate softball and decided coding would be
            a great way for me to learn about coding and allow me to
            use my passion for critical thinking while diving into a
            new field. My favorite hobbies include watching
            baseball and shopping </p>

        <p>
            I have never had true work experince because I have always
            taken sports very seriosly. I have been playing softball since
            the age of 10 and I was very blessed to recieve a full scholarship
            to attend any univerisity I wanted. For my full four years of college
            I was a student-athlete which is a full time job in itself.
