            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am from Miami, Florida. I am currently studying 
                nursing at FIU for my undergrad, I recently finished 
                playing collegiate softball and decided coding would be 
                a great way for me to learn about coding and allow me to 
                use my passion for critical thinking while diving into a 
                new field. My favorite hobbies include watching
                baseball and shopping </p>

            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <h3>student-athlete</h3>
            <p>
                I have never had true work experince because I have always
                taken sports very seriosly. I have been playing softball since
                 the age of 10 and I was very blessed to recieve a full scholarship
                 to attend any univerisity I wanted. For my full four years of college 
                 I was a student-athlete which is a full time job in itself.
